                <u><h2 style="line-height: 2vw;">2. Harry Potter & Prisoner of Azkaban</h2></u>
                <p>Prisoner of Azkaban is a turning point in the series, offering a darker and more complex story than its predecessors. The escaped convict Sirius Black casts a shadow over Hogwarts, while Dementors, soul-sucking creatures guarding the school, create a tense atmosphere. This book delves deeper into Harry's past and the mystery surrounding his parents' deaths. It's not all gloom, however, as Professor Lupin brings a warm presence and the time-turner adds a fascinating twist. While the darker tone might surprise some readers, the fast-paced plot, rich character development, and thrilling mystery solidify Prisoner of Azkaban as a favorite among fans.</p>
